# Public Health Study with Python

This project is an introductory exploration of Python, focusing on public health data analysis. It includes significant preprocessing steps to ensure data cleanliness and GDPR compliance.

## Project Structure

- **Melchiori_Manuel_1_notebook_052024.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis for the project.
- **Lexique des donn√©es.pdf**: A lexicon of the data used, providing definitions and explanations of the dataset variables.
- **Melchiori_Manuel_3_presentation_052024.pdf**: A presentation summarizing the project's findings and methodology.

## Project Objectives

1. **Code Cleanliness and Organization**:
    - Ensuring well-structured and readable code.
    - Following best practices in Python programming.

2. **Relational Algebra Operations**:
    - Performing joins to combine data from multiple sources.
    - Applying restrictions using `.loc` and column selections.
    - Aggregating data for meaningful insights.

3. **GDPR Compliance**:
    - Anonymizing data to protect personal information.
    - Ensuring that all preprocessing steps comply with GDPR regulations.

## Key Steps and Methods

- **Data Preprocessing**: 
    - Cleaning and organizing raw data.
    - Handling missing values and outliers.

- **Relational Algebra Operations**: 
    - Merging datasets using joins.
    - Filtering and selecting relevant data.

- **Data Aggregation**: 
    - Grouping data to generate summary statistics.
    - Visualizing aggregated data for better interpretation.
